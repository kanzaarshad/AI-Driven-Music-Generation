Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-driven music generation system that creates new musical compositions. Using a dataset of MIDI files, we will train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to learn musical patterns and generate original music sequences.

Overview:

Data Preparation: We will gather and preprocess a dataset of MIDI files, extracting musical notes and chords to create sequences suitable for training the LSTM model.
Model Training: A deep learning model will be trained to predict the next note in a sequence, learning from the patterns in the provided music dataset.
Music Generation: The trained model will generate new musical sequences by predicting subsequent notes based on a given input sequence.
Saving and Playing Music: The generated sequences will be converted back into MIDI format, allowing for playback and further use in creative projects.
